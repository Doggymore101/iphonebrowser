# iPhoneBrowser #
## Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7 GUI for manipulating files on jailbroken iOS devices ##
  * written using the Manzana.dll (http://code.google.com/p/manzana)
## Requires Quicktime ##
## <font color='red'>Important note</font> ##
  * Not all jailbreaks create the afc2 service needed by iPhoneBrowser.
  * <font color='red'>You can install the afc2add program in Cydia to add the service.</font>
  * You can manually create the service by editting the Services.plist file or using Erica Sadun's plutil. See http://code.google.com/p/iphonebrowser/issues/detail?id=153 or http://modmyi.com/forums/general/687870-blackra1n-iphonebrowser-2.html#post4991312
